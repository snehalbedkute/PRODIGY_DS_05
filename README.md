Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1:

Welcome to my submission for Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.In this task, I have analyzed traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The objective was to gain actionable insights and visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

🔍 Objective:
Analyze traffic accident data to identify trends and correlations.
Focus on variables such as weather conditions, road surface, and time of day.
Highlight accident-prone locations using visualization techniques.

📁 Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is Highway-Rail_Grade_Crossing_Accident_Data.csv , containing detailed records of traffic accidents at highway-rail intersections.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Project Highlights:
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and filtering relevant features.
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to study accident frequency across different conditions.
Created insightful visualizations including:
      Time-series plots for accident trends by hour and day
      Heatmaps for accident frequency by location
      Bar charts comparing accidents under different weather and road conditions
      Identified key factors contributing to high accident rates and visualized hotspots.
